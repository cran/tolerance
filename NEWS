*Changed the output for regtol.int(), nlregtol.int(),
 and npregtol.int() from class "matrix" to "data.frame".
*Updated K.factor() to also include the option method="EXACT",
 which does an exact calculation of two-sided k-factors
 by numerically solving the necessary integral calculation.
*Reflected the new exact method for calculating the k-factors
 above in the gamtol.int() and anovatol.int() functions.
*The function bonftol.int() was added to approximate two-sided
 tolerance intervals that control the proportion of the population
 in the tails.
*The function diffnormtol.int() was added for calculating one-sided
 tolerance limits for the difference between two independent
 normal random variables.  An exact calculation is performed when
 the variance ratio is known, while various estimation methods are
 used when the variance ratio is unknown.
*Updated references.

*Corrected acc.samp() function so that the output is of class
 "matrix".
*Changed the exp2tol.int() function so that it does not
 automatically truncate the lower tolerance limit at 0.
*The function paretotol.int() was added to estimate tolerance
 intervals for the Pareto distribution as well as the power
 distribution.

2010-05-16 (Version 0.2.1)
#######################################
*Started a "NEWS" file for changes in the package.
*Changed the way the k-factor for the two-sided linear and
 nonlinear regression tolerance intervals are calculated.  Before,
 an approximation was used.  A more accurate method (presented at the
 bottom of p. 70 of Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2009)) is used.
*Fixed a serious bug with the way nlregtol.int() checks that
 the pseudo-design matrix is, in fact, invertible.
*The function mvregtol.region() was added to estimate multivariate
 multiple linear regression tolerance factors.

#######################################
*New function anovatol.int() performs tolerance interval
 calculations for balanced ANOVA.
*New function np.order() performs sample size determination
 for tolerance limits based on order statistics.
*New function umatol.int() performs uniformly most accurate
 upper tolerance limits for the Poisson, binomial, and negative
 binomial distributions.
*Updated K.factor() to also include the option method="ELL"
 for the Ellison correction method.
*Updated acc.samp() to include the option RQL.  Documentation
 has also been updated to provide more detailed explanations of the
 function's arguments.
*Updated exttol.int() to also perform calculations for the
 Gumbel distribution for the maximum.  Before, this function only
 did calculations for the Weibull distribution and the Gumbel
 distribution for the minimum.
*The portion of code for gammatol.int() when side=2 was
 incorrect.  It has now been corrected.
*laptol.int(), logistol.int(), uniftol.int(), and
 exttol.int() all now include the option side=2 to estimate
 two-sided tolerance intervals.  The option simply calculates a
 Bonferroni approximation for the two-sided setting.
*uniftol.int() has now been written to for the general
 uniform case and not simply for the setting where the distribution
 has a lower bound of 0.
*plottol() has been updated so that pch=19 is used by default
 for all of the scatterplots.  It also includes functionality for a
 plot pertaining to output from the new anovatol.int() function.
*Fixed minor typos in the documentation (e.g., the Poisson
 tolerance intervals documentation originally said ``Poison").
*Added some additional references to some of the
 documentation.
