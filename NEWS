*The mvtol.region() function was updated to include many different ways to approximate the tolerance factor for
 multivariate normal data.  These were mainly included for comparative purposes.  The default method ("KM") is the 
 Krishnamoorthy-Mondal method, which was the method used in all previous versions of the 'tolerance' package.
*Fixed a bug in the K.table() function.  When summarizing by "n", the wrong indexing was used, thus yielding
 incorrect results.

#######################################
*The functions related to Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions have been updated. The distribution functions (i.e.,
 qzipfman, pzipfman, dzipfman, and rzipfman) have all been updated to be more efficient.  Moreover, there were
 some computational issues for extreme quantiles in these functions.  Namely, negative density values would
 be returned.  There have been corrections for these bugs, plus I have included an interpolation procedure
 when calculating very large quantities for the zeta distribution.  Deleted the "exact" option in the respective functions.
*The zipftol.int function has been updated to include the changes in the distribution functions.  There is
 also a new argument that allows the user to specify how to handle ties.  Namely, if the limit is calculated at
 a category that has the same frequency as other adjacent categories, then you can either take the most extreme of those
 tied categories (which would be the lowest of the tied categories for the lower limit and the highest of the tied categories
 for the upper limit) or simply take the category that was estimated by the procedure.  This latter approach would only be used
 if there is some scientific knowledge that could basically guide the user with setting an ordinal ranking of the tied
 categories.

2012-07-19 (Version 0.5.0)
#######################################
*Added code for using a fiducial approach to estimate tolerance intervals for the function of 
 two binomial proportions (fidbintol.int), two Poisson rates (fidpoistol.int), and two negative binomial
 proportions (fidnegbintol.int).
*Added three new options for estimating the two-sided K-factor for the normal setting: one due
 to Howe, one due to Krishnamoorthy and Mathew, and one for controlling the tail probabilities.  
 The exact method has also been made more efficient.  Also, corrected a small error in the normtol.int 
 function that did not allow the user to call all of the possible methods as cited in the documentation.
 The K.factor() function was also vectorized to accommodate a vector of sample sizes.
*Added a function that calculates Appell's hypergeometric function of the first
 kind (F1), distribution functions for the difference between two proportions (qdiffprop,
 pdiffprop, ddiffprop, and rdiffprop), and code for estimating tolerance intervals for the
 difference between two proportions using a fiducial-based approach (diffproptol.int). 
*Condensed the Zipf, Zipf-Mandelbrot, and zeta distribution functions into
 the qzipfman, pzipfman, dzipfman, and rzipfman functions.  This simultaneously
 corrected a minor bug in the original distribution functions of the three distributions.
 Searches on any of these distributions will now point to these new functions.  Future work will
 likely be done on these functions to make them more efficient.
*Added distribution functions (i.e., density, cumulative distribution,
 quantile, and random generation) for the negative hypergeometric
 distribution.
*Added the Krishnamoorthy-Mathew approach for computing the upper tolerance bound for the 2-parameter
 exponential distribution.
*Added neghypertol.int() function for calculating tolerance limits for
 negative hypergeometric random variables.
*Added hypertol.int() function for calculating tolerance limits for
 hypergeometric random variables.
*Added new options for how the confidence intervals for the
 binomial proportions are calculated in the bintol.int function.
 Specifically, the methods "PR", "PO", "CL", "CC", and "CWS" have been added,
 which are for the probit transformation, Poisson parameterization,
 complementary log transformation, continuity corrected large sample approach,
 and continuity corrected Wilson's approach, respectively.
*Added new options for how the confidence intervals for the
 Poisson rates are calculated in the poistol.int function.
 Specifically, the methods "CC", "VS", "RVS", "FT", and "CSC" have been added,
 which are for the continuity corrected large sample approach, the variance-
 stabilization approach, the recentered variance stabilization approach, the
 Freeman-Tukey method, and the continuity corrected score method, respectively.
*Completely overhauled the negbintol.int function, which was
 not providing good estimates.  The new version provides many
 ways to estimate the negative binomial proportion confidence intervals,
 similar to how the binomial and Poisson tolerance limits are constructed.
 An article has also been submitted outlining the procedure.
*The use of the ppois function was misspecified for the lower
 tolerance limit in the poistol.int function.  This resulted in the 
 reported lower limit being larger by 1 value.  This has been 
 corrected.
*Fixed the umatol.int function to allow the case of x = 0.
*Fixed a small typo in the negbintol.int documentation.
*Put maximum tolerance limits for the discrete distributions at Inf
 instead of 0.

 negative binomial random variables.
*Updated poistol.int() to also include the score method as a way to 
 estimate the tolerance limits.
*Added distribution functions (i.e., density, cumulative distribution,
 quantile, and random generation) for zeta, Zipf, and Zipf-Mandelbrot
 distributions.
*Added zm.ll() function for estimation of the shape parameter(s) in the
 zeta, Zipf, and Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions.

 algorithm had an error when parameter values were relatively large.


#######################################
2011-04-03 (Version 0.3.0)
#######################################
*Changed the output for regtol.int(), nlregtol.int(),
 and npregtol.int() from class "matrix" to "data.frame".
*Updated K.factor() to also include the option method="EXACT",
 which does an exact calculation of two-sided k-factors
 by numerically solving the necessary integral calculation.
*Reflected the new exact method for calculating the k-factors
 above in the gamtol.int() and anovatol.int() functions.
*The function bonftol.int() was added to approximate two-sided
 tolerance intervals that control the proportion of the population
 in the tails.
*The function diffnormtol.int() was added for calculating one-sided
 tolerance limits for the difference between two independent
 normal random variables.  An exact calculation is performed when
 the variance ratio is known, while various estimation methods are
 used when the variance ratio is unknown.
*Updated references.

2010-10-07 (Version 0.2.3)
#######################################
*Corrected acc.samp() function so that the output is of class
 "matrix".
*Changed the exp2tol.int() function so that it does not
 automatically truncate the lower tolerance limit at 0.
*The function paretotol.int() was added to estimate tolerance
 intervals for the Pareto distribution as well as the power
 distribution.


#######################################
2010-07-30 (Version 0.2.2)
#######################################
*Updated references.
*Fixed minor typos in documentation.


#######################################
2010-05-16 (Version 0.2.1)
#######################################
*Started a "NEWS" file for changes in the package.
*Changed the way the k-factor for the two-sided linear and
 nonlinear regression tolerance intervals are calculated.  Before,
 an approximation was used.  A more accurate method (presented at the
 bottom of p. 70 of Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2009)) is used.
*Fixed a serious bug with the way nlregtol.int() checks that
 the pseudo-design matrix is, in fact, invertible.
*The function mvregtol.region() was added to estimate multivariate
 multiple linear regression tolerance factors.


#######################################
2010-05-02 (Version 0.2.0)
#######################################
*New function anovatol.int() performs tolerance interval
 calculations for balanced ANOVA.
*New function np.order() performs sample size determination
 for tolerance limits based on order statistics.
*New function umatol.int() performs uniformly most accurate
 upper tolerance limits for the Poisson, binomial, and negative
 binomial distributions.
*Updated K.factor() to also include the option method="ELL"
 for the Ellison correction method.
*Updated acc.samp() to include the option RQL.  Documentation
 has also been updated to provide more detailed explanations of the
 function's arguments.
*Updated exttol.int() to also perform calculations for the
 Gumbel distribution for the maximum.  Before, this function only
 did calculations for the Weibull distribution and the Gumbel
 distribution for the minimum.
*The portion of code for gammatol.int() when side=2 was
 incorrect.  It has now been corrected.
*laptol.int(), logistol.int(), uniftol.int(), and
 exttol.int() all now include the option side=2 to estimate
 two-sided tolerance intervals.  The option simply calculates a
 Bonferroni approximation for the two-sided setting.
*uniftol.int() has now been written to for the general
 uniform case and not simply for the setting where the distribution
 has a lower bound of 0.
*plottol() has been updated so that pch=19 is used by default
 for all of the scatterplots.  It also includes functionality for a
 plot pertaining to output from the new anovatol.int() function.
*Fixed minor typos in the documentation (e.g., the Poisson
 tolerance intervals documentation originally said ``Poison").
*Added some additional references to some of the
 documentation.
