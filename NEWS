2010-XX-XX (Version 0.2.1)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Started a "NEWS" file for changes in the package.
  \item Changed the way the k-factor for the two-sided linear and
  nonlinear regression tolerance intervals are calculated.  Before,
  an approximation was used.  A more accurate method (presented at the bottom of
  p. 70 of Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2009)) is used.
  \item Fixed a serious bug with the way nlregtol.int() checks that
  the pseudo-design matrix is, in fact, invertible.
  \item The function mvregtol.region() was added to estimate multivariate multiple linear
  regression tolerance factors.
\end{itemize}

2010-05-02 (Version 0.2.0)
\begin{itemize}
  \item New function anovatol.int() performs tolerance interval
  calculations for balanced ANOVA.
  \item New function np.order() performs sample size determination
  for tolerance limits based on order statistics.
  \item New function umatol.int() performs uniformly most accurate
  upper tolerance limits for the Poisson, binomial, and negative
  binomial distributions.
  \item Updated K.factor() to also include the option method="ELL"
  for the Ellison correction method.
  \item Updated acc.samp() to include the option RQL.  Documentation
  has also been updated to provide more detailed explanations of the
  function's arguments.
  \item Updated exttol.int() to also perform calculations for the
  Gumbel distribution for the maximum.  Before, this function only
  did calculations for the Weibull distribution and the Gumbel
  distribution for the minimum.
  \item The portion of code for gammatol.int() when side=2 was
  incorrect.  It has now been corrected.
  \item laptol.int(), logistol.int(), uniftol.int(), and
  exttol.int() all now include the option side=2 to estimate
  two-sided tolerance intervals.  The option simply calculates a
  Bonferroni approximation for the two-sided setting.
  \item uniftol.int() has now been written to for the general
  uniform case and not simply for the setting where the distribution
  has a lower bound of 0.
  \item plottol() has been updated so that pch=19 is used by default
  for all of the scatterplots.  It also includes functionality for a
  plot pertaining to output from the new anovatol.int() function.
  \item Fixed minor typos in the documentation (e.g., the Poisson
  tolerance intervals documentation originally said ``Poison").
  \item Added some additional references to some of the
  documentation.
\end{itemize}

2009-06-29 (Version 0.1.0)
\begin{itemize}
  \item The `tolerance' package is officially launched.
\end{itemize}
